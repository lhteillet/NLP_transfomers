        "Here are the steps we need to follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The text need to be truncated if it's more than 256/512 tokens or padded if it's less than 256 or 512 tokens (depending on the model size). The words may also need to be separated into subword tokens: BERT-like models use different *tokenizers*, built to handle a fix-sized vocabulary. Any word that is not in the vocabulary is divided into subwords that are. BERT's tokenizer is based on *Wordpiece*.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. BERT uses special tokens, which will be added:\n",
        "    - [CLS] — Start token of every document\n",
        "    - [SEP] — Separator between each sentence\n",
        "    - [PAD] — Padding at the end of the document as many times as necessary, up to 256/512 tokens\n",
        "    - &#35;&#35; — Indicates the start of a subword, or \"word piece\".  \n",
        "\n",
        "We will use the **DistilBERT** model to save space (as it is a distilled version of the full BERT model), and we will use the uncased version. We need to be careful to use the corresponding tokenizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each model that you plan to use, you should read the corresponding description in the documention - here for [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html)."

To make things simpler, since have one label by sequence, we will consider that our task is to classify the full sequence (and not the ambiguous word *taken in context* as before).
